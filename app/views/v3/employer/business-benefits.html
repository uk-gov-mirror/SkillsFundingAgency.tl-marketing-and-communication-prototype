                        <p>
                            A commitment to industry placements raises your organisation's profile, locally and nationally, especially as T Levels gain more public exposure with your customers and clients.

                        <p>
                            Industry placements create opportunities for a diverse range of young people, not just those who've done A levels or gone to university. Diversity helps your organisation understand customers better, creates better performing teams and increases innovation and creativity.

                        </h3>
                        <p>
                            Traditionally, organisations have supported social causes by making charitable donations. Industry placements move your organisations beyond charity to help create 'shared value'. You still give back, but in a way that benefits the young people in your community as well as your business.

                        <p>
                            Placements create opportunities for staff to act as buddies, coaches or line managers to students. This helps existing staff gain management and mentorship skills, both of which are known to increase job satisfaction.

                        <p>
                            For smaller employers, young people can be an invaluable source of new and interesting ideas that can change the way you think about doing business.

                        <p>
                            In an environment where staff are doing multiple roles and struggling to meet difficult deadlines, an industry placement student could help support a key piece of work that you may not have had the time or resources to complete.
