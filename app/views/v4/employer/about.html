                    <p class="tl-lede">
                        In September 2020, the government launches T Levels: a new qualification for students aged 16 to 19 who’ve finished GCSEs. They’ll be the biggest reform to vocational training in a generation, giving young people the skills, knowledge, and attitude to excel in their careers.

                </h2>
                <p>The government has consulted with 220 employers to design T Level courses that deliver the skills your organisation needs.</p>
                <p>These employers span a range of industries, and include household names, such as Fujitsu, Skanska and GlaxoSmithKlein, as well as many smaller employers.</p>

                </h2>
                <p>Research shows that employers think the current range of vocational training courses is confusing and doesn’t always meet their needs.</p>
                <p>T Levels are part of the government’s plan to simplify vocational training and create a system that you can trust and understand. They’ll provide a clear and high quality, technical alternative to A levels.</p>
